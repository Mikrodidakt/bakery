# Shell

The shell subcommand will start a docker shell and setup the environment for the specified build config.

```bash
user@node:/dir$ bakery shell -c <config>
```

When starting a Bakery shell the config will be selected and used inside the shell. The terminal will present the following information

```bash
<user>@bakery-v<version>[<config>]:~/$
```

Each subcommand will be available as an alias with the build config predefined. Simply type the sub-command in the shell from any location
no need to specify bakery or the build config since it is already preset in the bakery shell

```bash
help
build
list
deploy
upload
setup
sync
```

# Bash

Currently bakery relay on bash and when the shell is started the /etc/bakery/bakery.bashrc needs to be sourced in by the /etc/bash.bashrc
if the bakery integration has been done in the docker image used by bakery. For information on how to to accomplish it please see [custom workspace image](docker.mk# Custom Worksapce Image).
The /etc/bakery.bashrc are available at https://github.com/Mikrodidakt/bakery/blob/main/scripts/bakery.bashrc.

## Aliases

The bakery rc-file will extend the shell by defining a couple of bakery alias which is just a functions making use of the BKRY env variables exposed in the shell.

```bash
Aliases:
  list     Aliase for 'bakery list -c product', list all tasks available
  build    Aliase for 'bakery build -c product', build all or a specific task
  clean    Aliase for 'bakery clean -c product', clean all or a specific task
  sync     Aliase for 'bakery sync -c product', sync the workspace
  setup    Aliase for 'bakery setup -c product', setup the workspace
  deploy   Aliase for 'bakery deploy -c product', deploy firmware to target
  upload   Aliase for 'bakery upload -c product', upload firmware to artifactory server
```
